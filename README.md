# Stack Choices & Decision-Making Process

## Overview

This project leverages a modern, productivity-focused stack to accelerate development, ensure maintainability, and enable rapid iteration. Below is a summary of the key technologies and tools used, along with the rationale behind each choice.

### AI Tooling

- **GPT (OpenAI) with Zed IDE**
  Used for code generation, architectural brainstorming, and rapid prototyping. GPT's integration with Zed IDE enabled context-aware suggestions and code completion, significantly speeding up development and reducing boilerplate.

- **Gemini**
  Utilized for documentation assistance and for breaking down complex code and architectural decisions. Gemini helped ensure that documentation is clear, concise, and accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Backend

- **Prisma ORM**
  Chosen for its type safety, developer experience, and seamless integration with modern TypeScript/JavaScript stacks. Prisma simplifies database migrations and querying, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
  Acts as the managed database layer. Supabase provides a scalable, secure, and developer-friendly Postgres environment, allowing us to focus on application logic rather than database operations.
